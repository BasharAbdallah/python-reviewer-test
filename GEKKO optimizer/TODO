ROADMAP / TODO LIST
===================

Front-End GUI in DASH
---------------------

Do it


Functionality
-------------

-add combined scheduling and control elements

-Expand functionality for modular units that connect with APM Connections

-Incorporate units package

-Read in CV params from results.json (tau, tr_hi, sp_hi, bias, err_hi, cost, etc)

-allow user to load custom .apm or .csv files?


Interface
---------

-Load back values of scalars not as list


Robustness
----------

-in IMODE=2 (MPU), look for an array with len>1 before starting to build csv. This avoids finding first_array when the variable is initialized with a scalar then throws errors for values initialized as arrays not of length 1

-if .dt() used and csv not provided, demand time variable

-"The value of MEAS is initialized to the initial model value. "

-ujson for speed

-pytest on tests http://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

-are results of FV/MV with STATUS = 0 in results.csv/json?

-case-insensitive reading of json

-Raise exception and direct to Equation() if the argument to Equations() is not a list


Code cleanup
------------

-clean up variable naming (1 function?)

-don't write csv if csv_read < 1 

-consense post-solve file reading functions so each file is only opened and processed once

-make model function writing prettier/shorter

-commas probably not needed in model file (variable=value,>lb,<ub --> variable=value <ub >lb)

-APM JSON input
